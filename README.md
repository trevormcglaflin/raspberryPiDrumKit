This is an app that I made to control a raspberryPiDrumkit. The goal of the project was to be able to play guitar over a drumkit that is controlled automatically. The drumkit is controlled by solenoid motors which are connected through a parallel circuit and relay channel to the raspberry pi GPIO pins. The user can choose between a few drum loops based on different time signatures, and they can also choose beats per minute. Here is a quick video demonstrating the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9mTp90ApKg
